accp
====

OpenACC parser and code generator for OmpSs(http://pm.bsc.es/ompss).

How?
ACCP can convert from OpenACC codes to OmpSs code. In our opinion standart-openACC and OmpSs approaches are very similar each other. Our aim in this project, to prove it. 

TODO
Currently it support only CAPS openACC.
